# Population-Health-Outcomes-Intervention-Optimization-Python-Tableau-
This project analyzes global population-level health outcomes using life expectancy and economic indicators. Python is used to perform descriptive, diagnostic, and prescriptive analytics, while Tableau transforms the insights into a polished, decision-ready dashboard.

The analysis examines how economic resources and temporal trends relate to health outcomes, identifies countries underperforming relative to expectations, segments populations into interpretable risk groups, and simulates how targeted interventions could improve predicted outcomes.

This mirrors real workflows in healthcare analytics, population health management, Medicaid intervention planning, and public-health decision support.

## 🎯 Objectives

Perform descriptive and diagnostic analytics to understand global variations in life expectancy.

Use regression modeling to quantify how economic factors and time trends influence health outcomes.

Apply clustering techniques to segment populations into meaningful risk groups.

Build scenario simulations to estimate how economic improvements impact projected life expectancy.

Create a Tableau dashboard summarizing KPIs, outcome gaps, clusters, and intervention insights.

Produce a portfolio-ready project demonstrating analytical rigor and healthcare-relevant thinking.

## ❓ Key Questions Answered
Understanding Population Health

* How do life expectancy levels vary globally?

* What is the overall gap between the highest- and lowest-performing populations?

* Which countries show meaningful declines or improvements over time?

Drivers of Health Outcomes

* How strongly is economic capacity (GDP) associated with life expectancy?

* Does log-transforming GDP reveal a more linear relationship?

* How much of life expectancy can be explained using a simple regression model?

Underperforming Populations

* Which countries have significantly lower life expectancy than expected given their economic scale?

* What do regression residuals reveal about outcome gaps?

* Can we identify populations requiring prioritized intervention?

Segmentation & Stratification

* How can clustering group countries into interpretable risk categories?

* What distinguishes “High-Risk,” “Elevated-Risk,” “Moderate-Risk,” and “Low-Risk” population segments?

 Intervention Planning

* If a country increases its economic resources by 10%, how would predicted life expectancy change?

* Which population clusters benefit most from targeted investment?

* How can scenario modeling inform policy or public-health planning?

## 📈 Results
Population Overview (KPIs)

Life expectancy varies widely across countries, with a ~28-year gap between the highest- and lowest-performing populations.

Significant inequality persists, even among economically similar groups.

Economic Drivers of Outcomes

Log-transformed GDP shows a strong, positive, and more linear relationship with life expectancy.

A simple regression model captures broad trends effectively (R² ≈ 0.8), indicating economic capacity and time trends explain a large share of health-outcome variance.

Underperformers & Outcome Gaps

Several countries fall well below predicted life expectancy, even after accounting for economic resources.

These underperformers represent priority candidates for targeted public-health interventions.

Population Segmentation

K-Means clustering groups populations into four coherent segments:

High Risk – low life expectancy and limited resources

Elevated Risk – improving outcomes but still below global averages

Moderate Risk – stable mid-range performance

Low Risk – highest life expectancy and strongest economic capacity

These clusters make intervention prioritization more actionable.

Scenario Simulations

A 10% increase in economic resources yields measurable improvements in predicted life expectancy, varying by cluster.

High-risk and underperforming clusters show the largest modeled gains, indicating where investment may maximize population-level impact.
